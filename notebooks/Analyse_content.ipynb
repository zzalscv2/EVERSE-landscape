       "- Regular provision of training and tutorials via developer workshops.\n",
       "- Implementing guidelines stipulated in grants\n",
       "- Encouraging the increased publishing of publications and presentations for the spread of knowledge.\n",
       "- Provision of training materials on an institutional level, within specific communities, or by individual experiments.\n",
