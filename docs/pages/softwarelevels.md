Interoperability is achieved by supporting common data formats, protocols, and APIs, enabling seamless integration with other tools and systems. Prioritising efficiency means optimising code to minimize resource usage and ensuring the software can handle large datasets or complex computations without performance degradation. Long-term maintenance requires planning for regular updates, securing funding, and providing detailed developer documentation to ease future enhancements and bug fixes. Finally, implementing mechanisms for feedback and bug reporting, such as issue trackers in GitHub, allows users to contribute to the software's continuous improvement, ensuring it remains responsive to their evolving needs. |

Key elements include writing automated tests (unit, integration, and regression tests) to ensure code correctness, using version control systems, and following code review processes to improve code quality. These practices help ensure that research software is reliable, maintainable, and reproducible.                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Planning; Development; Maintenance            | General guidelines                                          |

| 20 | As general guideline for software development and deployment is to keep the software packages and dependencies updated as much as possible, as working with outdated software can pose risks on the security of the software, especially if developing a front-end or back-end web infrastructure. Moreover, in general updating the dependencies and the overall environment can improve the execution time, and increase the efficiency of the software. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Development; Maintenance                      | General guidelines                                          |
